# JavaCosineCalculator
Basic text similarity checker using the cosine distance approach.

Basic user interface prompts user for two text files. The user can choose
to split words into new fixed word-size groupings (shingles), or kmers with 
a default value of 5. 

Cosine Similarity calculated and displayed in percentage correct two decimal places.

I will be working to implement extra functionality and improvements to it in the future
Any suggestions and/or changes more than welcome!
